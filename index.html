                Hello! My name is Linda, and welcome to my personal website. I created this website to share a bit about who I am, what drives me, and what I enjoy learning and creating.
                Iâ€™m a third-year student at Northeastern University, where I study Data Science and Finance. Beyond academics, Iâ€™m passionate about reading and traveling. These are two 
                pursuits that continue to shape how I see the world. Reading and traveling have always complemented each other in my life. Reading allows me to explore worlds through 
                words, while traveling lets me step directly into them. Both satisfy my curiosity and my desire to keep learning beyond familiar boundaries. Through reading, Iâ€™ve journeyed 
                across time and culture without leaving my room. Books have introduced me to distant places, new ideas, and lives unlike my own. Theyâ€™ve taught me empathy and given me an 
                endless sense of wonder about how vast and varied the world truly is. Travel brings those stories to life. Walking through ancient streets, tasting new foods, and connecting 
                with people from different backgrounds deepen the understanding that reading first sparked in me. Together, reading and traveling inspire my creativity, curiosity, and 
                growth. They remind me that the world is far bigger than I can ever fully knowâ€”but that the joy of discovery makes the journey worthwhile.
