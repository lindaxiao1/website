                Hello! My name is Linda, and welcome to my personal website. I created this website to share a bit about who I am, what drives me, 
                and what I enjoy learning and creating. Iâ€™m a third-year student at Northeastern University, where I study Data Science and Finance.
                Beyond academics, Iâ€™m passionate about reading. From the moment I learned how to read, I discovered a world far beyond my own. A 
                world filled with endless stories, knowledge, and imagination. Every book I open feels like an invitation to explore new places, 
                meet fascinating characters, and experience emotions I might never encounter in real life. Reading allows me to travel through time, 
                visit different cultures, and gain new perspectives without ever leaving my seat. What I love most about reading is its power to 
                transform the mind. It strengthens focus, expands vocabulary, and deepens understanding of the world. Whether itâ€™s a gripping mystery,
                a moving novel, or an inspiring biography, each page holds something valuable. Books have taught me empathy and patience, helping me 
                see life through the eyes of others. Reading also gives me comfort and peace. In times of stress or uncertainty, I turn to books for 
                escape and reflection. They remind me that I am never alone, someone, somewhere, has felt the same way I do. My passion for reading 
                continues to shape who I am, fueling my curiosity and inspiring me to keep learning for the rest of my life.
